I like to teach about how organizations and teams anticipate and respond to disruptive events while adapting to evolving digital work arrangements, with emphasis on crisis management, resilience, communication, and teamwork. I foster network thinking through social network analysis and systems thinking approaches to help students understand how connections between people and teams shape organizational outcomes.
