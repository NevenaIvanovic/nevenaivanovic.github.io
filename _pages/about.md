I am a postdoctoral researcher at Duke University, and a visiting scholar at the Fuqua School of Business.

My research focuses on understanding how individuals perform and interact to form successful and resilient teams and organizations within high-stakes, stressful, disruptive, and digitally-mediated work environments. I am particularly interested in how technology can be effectively integrated into the workplace to complement and enhance both human capabilities and interpersonal interactions.

My work investigates contexts such as critical infrastructures (water supply, railway systems), human-autonomy teaming environments (UAV operations), emerging work paradigms (virtual hackathons), and controlled environments (experimental group problem-solving). I employ quantitative methods, including social network analysis, on large-scale communication, and event logs data.

**Research interests:**

- Resilience and adaptation
- Social Networks
- Virtual teams
- Future of work
- Accelerated innovation
- Real-time feedback and performance optimization
- Human-technology interaction
