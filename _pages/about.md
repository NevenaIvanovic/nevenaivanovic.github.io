I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Groningen, Faculty of Economics and Business, in the Department of Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management.

My research focuses on optimizing human collaboration and integrating technology into organizational settings. I explore how technological advancements can complement human work practices, communication, and decision-making processes, providing insights that drive individual, team, and organizational innovation, resilience, and adaptability.

My work investigates contexts such as critical infrastructures (water supply, railway systems), human-autonomy teaming environments (UAV operations), emerging work paradigms (virtual hackathons), and controlled environments (experimental group problem-solving). I employ advanced quantitative methods, including social network analysis, on large-scale communication, event log, digital trace and wearable sensor data.

**Research interests:**

- Stress and disruption management
- Communication and coordination dynamics
- Social network analysis
- Virtual and distributed teamwork
- Accelerated innovation
- Real-time feedback and performance optimization
- Human-technology interaction
- Digital transformation



<!--My research focuses on understanding how individuals and teams perform and maintain well-being in high-stakes, disruptive, and digitally-mediated work environments. I am particularly interested in the behavioral and neurophysiological underpinnings of effective communication and coordination, and the role of technology in these processes. My work combines innovative data collection methods, including communication logs, wearable sensors, and digital trace data, with advanced analytical techniques such as network analysis and event sequence modeling.-->
