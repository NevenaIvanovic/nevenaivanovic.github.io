I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Groningen, Faculty of Economics and Business, in the Department of Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management.

My research focuses on understanding how individuals and teams perform and maintain well-being in high-stakes, disruptive, and digitally-mediated work environments. I am particularly interested in the behavioral and neurophysiological underpinnings of effective communication and coordination, and the role of technology in these processes. My work combines innovative data collection methods, including communication logs, wearable sensors, and digital trace data, with advanced analytical techniques such as network analysis and event sequence modeling.

**Research interests:**

- Organizational resilience
- Communication and coordination dynamics
- Virtual and distributed teamwork
- Accelerated innovation processes
- Social network analysis
- Physiological synchrony
- Human-technology interaction in the workplace
